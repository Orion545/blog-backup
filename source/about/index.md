### Update 2020/03/28

Build up OI society: half-way, yet received an outstanding team with me. Go SMS AlgorithmS!!!

Now finished 2 Wechat mini-apps (Image sorting & Road waterlog warning). Became a fully-developed full-stack developer with 10+ languages in arm! Next aim is to dig deep into the amazing Tensorflow 2.0 framework.

Participating in SMS's Representative Committee of Students. Personally I hope it will become the next SMS Council -- yet time is of essence, and my years at SMS are becoming shorter. Fight.

Currently learning to writing an application on Android, Java as well. Next target is to build a light-weight Wechat mini-application on rubbish sorting.
