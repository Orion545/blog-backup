The name is Orion545, a current high school student in Shenzhen, China.

Used to be a competitor in Olympics of Information (OIer), former ID Dedicatus545. Still taking part in OI, but I no longer take it as my major job. My next mission in OI is to build up the OI society in our school(Shenzhen Middle School).

Major in C++ && Python, as well as basic techniques for Tensorflow && CSS.

Currently learning to writing an application on Android, Java as well. Next target is to build a light-weight Wechat mini-application on rubbish sorting.
