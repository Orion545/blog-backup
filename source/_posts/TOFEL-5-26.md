# Tips & Inspirations

## Reading

Nothing really important, just need to do some more vocabulary.

When placing sentences, MIND their association with the sentence that is going to be behind it: most time there will be some relationship.

Listening

Not a pretty good score, but scarcely acceptable, I think.

Theatre-based conversations/lectures are one of my hradships, should practice more on it, or learn some basic knowledge about this topic.

Most Problems are limited to s certain part of the speech, so NEVER interfere with other parts when choosing.

Still that same philosophy: take choices as ABSOLUTE ones instead of a mild opinion.
