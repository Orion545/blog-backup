## General Impression

Most of my problems still focus on Logic, although I'm having a not bad logic. I usually jump over logic links in my mind during writing and speaking, so many of my creations seems not linked with each other.

Issues on Reading and Listening are not that significant, writing and speaking conducts the most problems.

## Speaking

Mind the vocabulary use and tense use! These are minor mistakes but piling them up leads to a lower score.

Most of the time vocabularies are not really demanding, but you must use them in the correct way. That is, you shall avoid paraphrases that you are not familiar with or are not sure if it is correct. Stability is of the first concern here, since what you need to do is to just illustrate the information, and that's it!

USE SIMPLE LOGIC. There is no need to explain the very base of everything.

Most of the time we are doing summaries, so do not add ANY your own taste in it(except for task 1 and 2).

## Writing

Just need to get to know the major characteristics of writing tests.

In the integrated part, just use the predefined structure and trasmit enough information. THIS IS ENOUGH FOR INTEGRATED. No real need to show off your ability: leave that to the independent writing.
