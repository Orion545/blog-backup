# TPO Reading 48

Harder than expected, got only 25/30 with 37/42 correction rate.

Main mistakes are the last question of each passage.

I find it important that in TOFEL test, a correct choice will always be correct, and every word of it will be correct as well.
Therefore it’s quite essential to check every statement in a choice thoroughly in the passage. Even if it seems obvious, it may not be a major idea or has some minor misunderstanding from the original text.

For some topics(Paleontology for example), it is usual that specific words may confuse you, since they might be professional nouns of that certain topic. In this situation, I think it is better not to focus on the precise definition of the word, but only take it as a name like John or Kate. By that way, maybe I can take the word as x in equations: focus on its qualities, so that the questions are well answered.

# TPO Reading 47

Done just after TPO48, got 29/30 with 40/42 correction rate.

I guess this score was mainly because of my good status after finishing TPO48 :)

Still the same cautious point: check every word of a choice to see if it is correct.

# TPO Listening 48

Medium level, got 28/30 with 33/34 correction rate.

The only mistake was a single choice, and the reason of it must be blamed to my carelessness.

I guess there won’t be much problem on this listening.

# More to discuss

Just started to use Quizlet on tackling with my writing phrase usage.

Felt great about this app on the first glance, got fascinated by its design and its use of ML.

Might be inspirational to me!
